AutoLaparo dataset Task 1 - Surgical workflow recognition:
----------------------------------------

# Files:
This folder includes:
- 21 laparoscopic hysterectomy videos (.mp4)
- 21 phase annotations at 1 fps (.txt)
- README.txt

## The procedure of laparoscopic hysterectomy is divided into 7 phases:
1    Preparation
2    Dividing Ligament and Peritoneum
3    Dividing Uterine Vessels and Ligament
4    Transecting the Vagina
5    Specimen Removal
6    Suturing
7    Washing

## Dataset splitting
The dataset splitting of benchmark results in paper: 01-10 for training, 11-14 for validation and 15-21 for testing.
